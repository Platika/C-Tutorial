/* (5) So nested with in this header file are some more preprocessor commands let's see if we can make sense of them! */

#ifndef Header___Prototypes_firstheader_h // So this is an if statement which says if not defined and then the name of our header do...
#define Header___Prototypes_firstheader_h // the first thing the pre processor is going to do is define and store the name of our header. This is important since it protects us from running this header file more then once!

void aroundtheWorld(); // Now it's going to run whatever instruction we've put in it.

#endif // Then it's going to end it's if statement and we can return back to our main file.
